A Tkinter lightweigth graphical interface to download magnet links from the 
slow http://tntvillage.scambioetico.org. The interface interacts with the 
software Transmission (https://transmissionbt.com) via transmission-daemon.
With this software you are able to search and download magnet links and 
directly send these to Transmission client, why? The TNTVillage site is 
very slow when you access with a browser.
